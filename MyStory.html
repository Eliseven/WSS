  <p id="story">After one and a half years of being an only child, the first of a bunch of younger siblings was born. A little sister. From the start, things weren't quite right, but it took four months to get the diagnosis of Willians syndrome. It didn't make any difference in my life because I was only one and a half years old and this was all I knew. I dont remember ever being told my sister is different or that she has Williams Syndrome, I just always knew.  At nearly three years old, she was diagnosed with Autism. This explained why all of her behaviors were so atypical of Williams Syndrome. She only started talking at five years old and even now, she can express her wants and needs, but not carry a conversation. My sister has always gone to special ed. schools and Camp HASC is her favorite place in the world. My dream has always been to work there because I grew up with my sister loving it and going there on visiting day.Unlike my other siblings, I got very interested in disabilities at a relatively young age. I read about and watched documentaries about any disability, not just Williams Syndrome. My sister and I share a love for music which is our means of connection. I have memories of sitting on the couch together and singing. I am very lucky that I never got bullied because of my sister and I was never made to feel different. I think this is because I never made it into a bad or weird thing. I would casually stick the facts into conversations and I was open to discusson. I also did a few school projects about my sister because I found the topic interesting and it was a convenient choice for me.  I never questioned the fact that my sister was different until I was about 15 years old. That was when I first started to notice other girls my age who had typically developing sisters the same age as my sister. This was the first time I realized what I was missing and it was hard. I wished that I had someone to talk to who would actually understand what I was feeling. I didn't know anyone in my situation and at times I felt alone. I would lay in bed and think of how things would be different if my sister was “normal” and I would wish I could talk to someone in a similar situation. I dont want anyone else to have to go through that, so I created WSS.
